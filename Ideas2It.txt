And it is now up to you to demonstrate your hunger and passion for growth. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nFor starters, Ideas2IT works on some really innovative projects.

There are Hackathons, Shark Tanks and many other platforms for you to show what you are made of. The management and leadership is all ears to have anything you have to say. And if what you say makes sense, they are more than happy to let you make the idea a reality. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nIt’s like working for a startup, but with zero risks. Why zero risks? Well, Ideas2IT is a 12 years old company and financially very stable. Unlike the many “product startups” that shut down. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nFor dessert - there’s the rewards.

I got fed up and wantedto look for company to grow upto my strengthses. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nI joined Ideas2IT, because they don’t do Managed Services. I was placed in proper Product Development project for very large healthcare clinet. I had lots of learning to do. But I gave my best. I have been here for the past 3 years now. I have worked on 2 more innovation projeckts. So much exposure and so much growth. I realize how I wasted my 3 yrs with CTS. I gained so much more at Ideas2IT. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nMy friends at CTS hate me because of my growth here. They all told me why to join small company. But Ideas2IT is not small company - it is a much bigger company when you consider good projeckts, very big clients, very high rewards for acheevements, very good culture and high growth work.

The company’s decision very early on to not take up legacy maintainance projects and focus only on product engineering projects. To be a software company that is completely focussed on the latest technologies. And to create a workforce that meets the company’s objectives, this leads to a very good company to work. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nSo people here are super smart and super talented. But they are alos very humble and do not show attitude, even with juniors and freshers. They will treat you like siblings brother sisters and alwyas share their knowledge to guide you and mentor you. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nThen you have managerment that is open to fresh thoughts and ideas. They is no distinction based on seniority. Even frehser and junior can lead initiatives if they have the capacity. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nThen we come to work culture. Very good job satisfaction. Good salary and good rewards. Now ESOP also is there for all employees. The only weakness is for the company Ideas2IT, not employees.

I decided to take a risk and joined Ideas2IT, based on feedback from my collegemates who joined there as freshers. On joining, I immediately realized that my collegemates who joined Ideas2IT were far ahead of me, technically. They had undergone a very good training on how to approach problems innovatively and solve them. I was kicking myself for not joining there as a fresher. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nAnyways, after clearing what was a very interesting interview (full of problem solving puzzles, etc.), I joined here. I was allowed to learn a lot of technologies that I did not learn previously. In some time, a lot of companies started calling me for interviews. It was then that I realized how much value Ideas2IT adds to people’s careers. _x000d_\n_x000d_\nI am very happy here and sticking on. The work culture is very good.

But the benefit of the tag stops there. And then there’s Ideas2IT. A 500 people company. But rich with innovative projects, talented people, and an awesome work culture that binds all of this together. They don’t have the budgets for brand promos like the biggies, but their rewards are just the best. It’s no wonder that Ideas2IT’s attrition is so low. This is the same thought-process I went through during my interview. I went by my instinct. I have been an Ideator for the past 6 years now and it’s probably the best career decision I have made. It’s like I have found this place and family that I have been waiting for all my life. I gladly recommend Ideas2IT to everyone who’s aspiring to become the best professional versions of themselves.

And there is always some engagement activity by the HR. Very few cons to speak of. The company needs to do more brand-building activities.', '34 What I like about Ideas2IT the most is that everything is centred around us Ideators. I am a big fan of their CSR policy. Unlike most other companies, they don’t simply write cheques and treat it like a line item in some checklist. Ideas2IT’s Founder has some very clear ideas for CSR. We Ideators pitch a cause that moves our hearts and he is more than happy to fund it. As long as we take the responsibility of carrying the initiative across the finish line. I don’t have enough words to appreciate the company’s employee-centric CSR policies. Kudos, Ideas2IT! You need to put in some effort to understand the essence of what Ideas2IT is. Once you do that, you are set here for a long long time.', '35 1.
